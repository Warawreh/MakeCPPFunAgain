# 07 — Optional Preview: Errors & Assertions

## Goals
- See how C++ reports runtime errors.
- Understand `try/catch` and `assert` at a high level.

## Topics
- `throw` and `try/catch`
- `std::runtime_error`
- `assert` for simple checks

## Notes
This is a brief preview. Deeper error handling comes later, after control flow and functions.

## Exercises
- Throw an error when a value is invalid.
- Add an `assert` that checks a precondition.
