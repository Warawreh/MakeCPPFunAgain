# 03 — Mini Project: Greeting & Calculator

## Goals
- Combine variables, arithmetic, and output in a small project.
- Practice editing values and observing output changes.

## Project idea
Build a tiny **greeting + calculator** in a notebook cell:
- Ask for a name (or set a variable)
- Print a greeting
- Compute and print `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` on two numbers

## Exercises
- Change the numbers and observe results.
- Add one more operation (e.g., modulus) and print it.

## Note
Functions and modular code appear in **Stage 3**. This project keeps everything inline to reduce friction in early learning.
