# 02 — Basics: Hello World, Variables, Types, I/O

## Goals
- Write and run a minimal C++ program in a notebook cell.
- Declare variables and use basic types.
- Print values and simple expressions.

## Topics
- `std::cout` for output
- Variables: `int`, `double`, `bool`, `std::string`
- Simple arithmetic and expressions
- Brief use of `auto`

## Notes
Stage 1 focuses on **fundamentals**. Control flow (loops/conditionals) is introduced in Stage 2. Here we emphasize syntax, variables, and output.

## Exercises
- Modify a greeting to include name and age.
- Calculate the area of a circle using `radius`.

## Quick quiz (conceptual)
- Which type should you use for fractional values?
- What is the output of `3 + 4 * 2`?
