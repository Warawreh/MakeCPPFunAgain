# 05 — Optional Preview: Core Containers

## Goals
- Get a first look at `std::string`, `std::vector`, and `std::array`.

## Topics
- `std::string` for text
- `std::vector` for dynamic lists
- `std::array` for fixed-size collections

## Notes
Containers are expanded in Stage 3. Here we just preview the syntax so students recognize them when they appear later.

## Exercises
- Reverse a string.
- Compute an average from a vector of numbers.
