# 01 — Tooling & xcpp workflow

## Goals
- Understand how xcpp/xeus-cling notebooks execute C++.
- Learn include paths and project headers.

## Topics
- Notebook execution model (cell-by-cell).
- Include paths for this repo.
- Using `include/mcppfa/notebook_setup.hpp`.

## Quick start
```cpp
#include "include/mcppfa/notebook_setup.hpp"
```

## Exercises
- Run a cell that prints "hello".
- Include a header from include/mcppfa and call one function.
